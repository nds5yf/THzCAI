Noah Sauber and Michael Eller

This Repo is used to document the vector coded aperture imaging project at the UVa FIR Lab.
We are working under Dr. Robert Weikle to research and develop a method to produce images using
electromagnetic waves on the scale of 1 THz.

Special Recognition for their contributions to this project:
Alex Arsenovic, Souheil Nadri, and Henry Bishop
